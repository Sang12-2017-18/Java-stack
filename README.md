# Java-stack
Improving efficiency of array stack in java
I have only 3 questions to ask:
     Can I declare push(), pop() and display() in another class and use it in my main class(sang13)? If yes,how?
     Why should the variables A[][] and top be declared as public static?(It does not compile otherwise).
     How can I reduce the compile time of this code?(except reducing the no of lines)
